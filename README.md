# Tik Tak Toe

Welcome to the Tik Tak Toe interview. This interview is designed to explore how you approach new, open ended problems. At Mito, we often build new features in new parts of our codebase, so being able to build something from scratch is important to succeeding at Mito. 

Your task is simple, build a playable tik tak toe game in React. Our goal is to end the interview by playing eachother in tik tak toe!

### Tik Tak Toe Rules 

Tik Tak Toe is a two player game. Players take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. One player is "X" and the other player is "O". The first player to place three marks in a row (veritcally, horizontally, or diagnollal) is the winner. If no player has won after all nine squares are marked, the game is a tie.
